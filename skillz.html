                <p>Every year we send representatives of our class to an event called Skills USA. I don't know if you've heard of it, but, it's a pretty big deal for us. There are 2 categories that we compete in, broadcasting, and video editing. And as far as I know we've cleaned up in every single competition we've been in.</p>

                <p>The creator of this website has been told that he is in the running to go to Skills for video editing. So that's really cool.</p>
