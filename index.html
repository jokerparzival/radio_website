        <p>We broadcast on 106.1 in Savannah Tennessee. Everyday we go on air and read the latest news, sports, and weather to all the listeners in the county. We take sponsorships from local buisnesses to support us. We even have stories about our highschool play on air (some can be found in archives). Every week we also get a special spot on WKWX 93.5 for tiger update. Where we tell an even larger audience about our school. </p>
