            <p>Along with being responsible for what goes on the radio, we're also responsible for video projects as well. Our biggest project ever was the Lip Dub. A Lip Dub is when we get footage of students dancing down the hall with other students around them. Then we dub over the footage with music.</p>
            <p>So far, we have two Lip Dubs under our belt, the first has over 600,000 views! The other has about 7,000, but is expected to rise over time. Pretty good for a small town high school.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0fgIdBXpSQ">This is our first Lip Dub filmed in September of 2018</a></p>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTRhiwBHFRk">Here's our second, filmed in January 2020.</a></p>
            <p>Both made by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYXr-5IYvaACysCUMKBrNdw"> Tiger Media, AKA Tiger Radio Youtube Channel!</a></p>
